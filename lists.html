			Lists in WormMine are a series of multiple items that can be eother created by the user or provided by WormMine. Lists can be used as search terms in new queries or templates, while they can be part of unions, intersections and subtractions from other lists. WormMine lists can accept most types of IDs present in the database, and they can be created from multiple types of IDs at the same time (i.e. Uniprot name and WormBase protein IDs). In order to take full advantage of lists, is recommended that the user is logged in their account.
